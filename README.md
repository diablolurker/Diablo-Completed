# Lost in the Matrix

Everything I do is different (Oh, yeah)
I am, lost in the Matrix
I need a face-lift, drive in my spaceship
Get out my space, bitch, get out my face, bitch
I can't believe we made it this far
I can't believe we made it this far
I can't believe we made it this far
I can't believe we made it this far
Hand in the sky (Hand in the ahh)
I can't believe I made it this far
I'm just tryna tell you how I feel, tell you how I feel
